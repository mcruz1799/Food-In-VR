# Food-In-VR
Spring 2018: Virtual Reality Research Project

I served as lead developer on this VR research project testing how one's environment affects hunger, cravings, and satiety.

Our team created 3 virtual rooms comprised of either sweet, umami, or savory foods. The world was intense, with foods raining from the sky and randomly spawning throughout. 

We placed our subjects within one of these worlds for 5 minutes at a time.

Before and after their experience we asked them to list their favorite foods, their current hunger, and what they were currently craving. 

After putting 30 people through the simulation, we had two core findings. 
  1) There was no significant evidence that a person's virtual environment influenced their craving for the type of food they were surrounded with.
  2) There seemed to be evidence that placing a person in any virtual environment with food made them feel hungrier.

This project was created using Unity, C#, the Steam Software Development Kit, and Unity Teams for collaboration. 

I developed the following functionality:
  1) Users could pick up foods
  2) Users could "eat" foods (they would press a button on the controller to initiate a "munch" sound and destroy the objects)
  3) Food would randomly spawn from the sky and fall to the ground
  4) Worked with designers to insert their models into the scene according to their layout

This was my introduction to Unity and programming for Virtual Reality.

I learned about practically applying Object Oriented Programming and creating a robust Software Architecture which I built upon in later projects.
